          <p>
            I have always been a great problem solver, an independent extrovert,
            and a technophile obsessed with the latest technology. Currently I
            am a Graduate Student majoring in Computer Science. I started to
            learn coding as as an auxiliary subject at school and with time and
            knowledge realized this is the right career for me. My interests
            include Software Design and Development, Java Programming, Python,
            Data science, Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. I am a
            curious and enthusiastic individual looking to be challenged on a
            daily basis and love adding new skills to my repertoire. Along with
            the coursework, I enjoy working on Kaggle competitions and LeetCode
            using Java and Python programming languages.
