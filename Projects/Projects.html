        <h3><li>Wikipedia Comment Classifier</li></h3>
        <h5>April - May 2022</h5>
          <p>
            Wikipedia Comment Classifier Built a Machine Learning Model that
            could classify wikipedia comments as personal attack or not using
            information from multiple annotators.

          <h3><li>Predicting Boston House Prices</li></h3>
          <h5>June - July 2021</h5>

          <p>
            A machine learning model using linear regression was developed to
            predict the monetary value of houses. The dataset used represented
            information about 14 features of homes from different suburbs
            located in Boston. Various python libraries like sklearn,
            matplotlib, pandas and numpy were used.

          <h3><li>Rock, Paper, Scissor in Python</li></h3>
          <h5>April - May 2021</h5>
          <p>
            The age-old rock, paper and scissors game was created in python
            using variables, list, while loop, if-elif-else ladder and a special
            randint method that was imported from the random module.
          </p>
          <h3><li>Content Identification</li></h3>
          <h5>February - March 2021</h5>
          <p>
            The aim was to use pre-existing data and machine learning algorithms
            to recognize the text in images and translate the text into
            different languages according to user preference.
          </p>
          <h3><li>Iris Dataset</li></h3>
          <h5>January - February 2021</h5>
          <p>
            Support Vector Machine algorithm was used for the Iris
            classification problem that can classify different species of the
            Iris flower. The classification was done using four features: sepal
            length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width using a data set
            of 150 samples out of which 80% of the samples were used for
            training and the remaining 20% for validation of the algorithm.

          <h3><li>Shopping Mall Database</li></h3>
          <h5>August - September 2020</h5>
          <p>
            A database of all the necessary information of a shopping mall like
            the customers, the products they purchased and their contact
            information was created using oracle.
